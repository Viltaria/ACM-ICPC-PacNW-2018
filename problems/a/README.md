# Exam

## Solution Mindset

We are given three things:

1. Number of answers our friend got right `k`
2. Our friend's answers 
3. Our own answers

Knowing these, we can calculate for the amount of total possible questions we could have gotten correct with the following equation:

`# of answers - |# of same answers - # of answers our friend got right|`
