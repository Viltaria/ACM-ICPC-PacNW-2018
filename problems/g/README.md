# Goat on a Rope

## Solution Mindset

If we think about this problem, we can realize that the closest point of the house from the goat will be either one of the four sides of the house, or one of the four corners. 

Knowing this, we just have to figure out which side/corner we need to calculate the distance from. We can do this by checking each side/corner individually to see if they are the closest valid point of contact.
